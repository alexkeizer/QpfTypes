## Differences with Previous QPFTypes

The main difference with v0.1 is that v0.2 no longer provides a single `codata`
or `data` command. The user is expected to explicitly define the base functor
as a regular `inductive` type, which can automatically be shown to be a QPF
via a new `deriving QPF` mechanism. The user then defines their final
(co)inductive type explicitly as a (co)fixpoint of this functor, in a regular
definition. A `@[qpf_type]` attribute is provided to automatically generate
constructors as before.

Further changes are:

* The theory of QPFs is now part of the QPFTypes library,
    removing the dependency on Mathlib.
* Live parameters are now encoded using the `liveParam` gadget, inspired by how
  `outParam` & co work for annotating parameters of a type class. Unannotated
  parameters are considered "dead" (i.e, non-functorial) by default.
* The theory of (selective) QPFs has been augmented with a partial ordering,
  so that corecursive functions can be defined via Lean's `partial_fixpoint`
  mechanism

## Acknowledgements

The theory of QPFs has been largely adapted from the relevant files in
[Mathlib](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4).
License and Authorship notices of those files have been preserved.
The theory of QPFs was first described by Jeremy Avigad, Mario Carneiro,
and Simon Hudon. [1]

The ordering on coinductive types that enables the CCPO structure is based on
discussions with Michael Sammler, and his
[coinductive](https://github.com/ISTA-PLV/coinductive) library.
